# Switching Back to Range-Based Risk Assessment

## Problem
After implementing GPU-trained Gaussian Process models, all signal confidences were clustering around 60%, providing no meaningful differentiation between good and bad trades.

## Solution: Use the Revolutionary Range-Based Method

The system already has a sophisticated range-based method that was giving great performance before GP training. This method:

1. **Analyzes optimal profit ranges** from historical data
2. **Uses graduated feature importance** specific to each instrument and direction
3. **Provides clear confidence differentiation** based on whether features fall in OPTIMAL, ACCEPTABLE, or POOR ranges

## How to Switch

### 1. Update Environment Configuration
Edit `/risk-service/.env`:
```env
ENABLE_GP_INTEGRATION=false
ENABLE_AB_TESTING=false
```

### 2. Restart Risk Service
```bash
cd risk-service
# Stop the service (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
npm start
```

## What This Changes

### Before (GP Method)
- All confidences ~60.3%
- High uncertainty due to limited training data
- No clear signal differentiation

### After (Range-Based Method)
- **OPTIMAL ranges (80-95% confidence)**: Features match profitable trade patterns
- **ACCEPTABLE ranges (40-80% confidence)**: Features partially match successful patterns
- **POOR ranges (10-40% confidence)**: Features outside profitable ranges

## How Range-Based Works

1. **Profitable Pattern Analysis**
   - Separates winning trades from losing trades
   - Calculates Q25-Q75 ranges for optimal conditions
   - Calculates P10-P90 ranges for acceptable conditions

2. **Feature-by-Feature Evaluation**
   - Each feature checked against its profitable range
   - Features scored as OPTIMAL, ACCEPTABLE, or POOR
   - Overall confidence based on aggregate scoring

3. **Instrument-Specific Intelligence**
   - MGC long prefers low volatility (atr_percentage: 0.019-0.034)
   - Each instrument/direction has unique profitable characteristics
   - Graduation tables update every 30 minutes based on trade outcomes

## Example Confidence Calculations

### High Confidence Trade (85%+)
- Most features in OPTIMAL range
- Low volatility environment
- Pattern matches historical winners

### Medium Confidence Trade (50-70%)
- Mix of OPTIMAL and ACCEPTABLE features
- Some uncertainty but positive indicators

### Low Confidence Trade (10-40%)
- Multiple features in POOR range
- High volatility or adverse conditions
- Pattern matches historical losers

## Monitoring

Watch the logs for range-based analysis:
```
[MEMORY-RISK] Range-based confidence: 78.5% (23 features analyzed)
[MEMORY-RISK] Range analysis: APPROVED - High confidence: 5 OPTIMAL, 12 ACCEPTABLE, 6 POOR features
```

## Benefits of Range-Based Method

1. **Clear differentiation** - Trades get meaningful confidence scores
2. **Market intelligence** - Understands what conditions lead to profits
3. **Continuous learning** - Updates ranges based on new trade outcomes
4. **No overfitting** - Uses statistical ranges, not complex models
5. **Interpretable** - You can see exactly why a trade was approved/rejected

The range-based method is battle-tested and was providing excellent results before the GP experiment. Switching back should immediately improve signal quality and confidence differentiation.
