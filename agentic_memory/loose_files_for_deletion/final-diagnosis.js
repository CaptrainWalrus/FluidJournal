console.log('=' .repeat(80));

console.log(`
üìä PROBLEM SUMMARY:
-----------------
1. 77 out of 94 features are CONSTANT across 1057 stored vectors
2. Entry types show as "MGC_unknown_unknown" 
3. PnL often $0 with exit reason "UNKNOWN"
4. MaxProfit/MaxLoss are always 0
5. consecutive_up_bars/down_bars only show 0 or 1

üîç ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
-------------------------

1. MISSING DATA FLOW:
   - The logs show NO position registrations/deregistrations
   - This means NinjaTrader ‚Üí ME position tracking is BROKEN
   - Without position tracking, features are generated in isolation

2. FEATURE GENERATION TIMING:
   - Features are being generated but NOT at position exit
   - The generateSignalFeatures() is called but with no context
   - This explains why entry_type is "unknown_unknown"

3. CALCULATION ERRORS:
   - EMA3 returns 'undefined' (needs our fix applied)
   - VWAP returns 'undefined' (needs our fix applied)  
   - Other calculations work (RSI = 54.18) but with static data

4. BARS DATA ISSUE:
   - MI service IS returning data (status 200)
   - But bars_available is not being logged
   - Suggests bars array might be empty or malformed

5. MAXPROFIT/MAXLOSS TRACKING:
   - These require bar history during position lifetime
   - Since positions aren't being tracked, these stay at 0
   - The getBarHistoryForPosition() is never called

üõ†Ô∏è FIXES NEEDED:
----------------

1. IMMEDIATE: Restart ME service with EMA3/VWAP fixes
2. CHECK: Is NinjaTrader actually calling RegisterPosition/DeregisterPosition?
3. CHECK: Are positions being stored at the RIGHT time (exit, not entry)?
4. FIX: Ensure position tracking captures bar history for MaxProfit/MaxLoss
5. FIX: Pass signalType and signalDefinition from NT to ME

üìù DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:
---------------------
1. Check if NT is sending position events:
   - Look for "RegisterPosition" calls in NT logs
   - Verify ME endpoints are being hit

2. Check ME position tracking:
   - Look for "[POSITION-TRACKING]" logs in ME
   - Verify activePositions Map has entries

3. Check feature generation context:
   - Features should be generated WITH position data
   - Not in isolation from market updates

The core issue is that the position lifecycle is broken, causing features to be 
generated without proper context, resulting in static/default values.
