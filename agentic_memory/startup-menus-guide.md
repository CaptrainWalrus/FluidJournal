# Startup Menus Guide

## Overview

Three separate startup menus have been created for easier management of the Agentic Memory system:

1. **Storage Menu** (`storage-menu.js`) - Manages vector storage and data operations
2. **Risk Menu** (`risk-menu.js`) - Manages ML models and risk agent operations  
3. **GP Menu** (`gp-menu.js`) - Manages Gaussian Process models and training

All menus are designed to be simple, robust, and use existing scripts to avoid breaking easily.

## Technical Details

### Service Ports
- Storage Agent: 3015
- Risk Service: 3017  
- GP Service (Python): 3020

### Data Locations
- Vector Storage: `storage-agent/data/vectors/`
- ML Models: `gp-service/models/`
- Logs: Each service directory

### Dependencies
- Node.js 14+ for JavaScript services
- Python 3 for GP Service

## Integration Notes

These menus work with the existing system architecture:
- All operations use existing scripts and APIs
- No new dependencies introduced
- Robust error handling
- Simple execSync calls to proven commands

The menus are intentionally simple to ensure reliability and ease of use, following the principle: "all the functions work through other scripts so this shouldn't break so easily".

## Quick Reference

You can now use these menus by running:
- `node storage-menu.js` for storage operations
- `node risk-menu.js` for model and risk agent operations
- `node gp-menu.js` for Gaussian Process model management
