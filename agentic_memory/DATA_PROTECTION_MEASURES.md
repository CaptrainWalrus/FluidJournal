# Data Protection Measures - CRITICAL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY ACTIONS TAKEN

### üö® Dangerous Scripts Disabled
The following scripts have been **DISABLED** to prevent accidental data loss:

- `wipe-storage.js.DISABLED` - Mass data deletion script
- `wipe-storage-auto.js.DISABLED` - Automated wipe script  
- `wipe-storage-api.js.DISABLED` - API-based wipe script
- `wipe-storage-complete.js.DISABLED` - Complete storage wipe
- `clear-storage.js.DISABLED` - Storage clearing script

**These files have been renamed with .DISABLED extension and cannot be executed**

### üõ°Ô∏è API Endpoint Protection
The dangerous bulk delete endpoint has been **DISABLED**:

- `POST /api/vectors/delete-bulk` ‚Üí `POST /api/vectors/delete-bulk-DISABLED`
- Returns 403 Forbidden with data protection message
- Original code is commented out

### ‚úÖ Safe Operations Still Available
- Individual vector deletion: `DELETE /api/vector/:id`
- Data export: `GET /api/export/csv`
- Read operations: All GET endpoints
- New data storage: All POST storage endpoints

## üîí Prevention Measures

1. **No Bulk Operations** - Only individual record deletion allowed
2. **Script Renaming** - All wipe scripts disabled by file extension
3. **API Protection** - Bulk delete endpoint returns 403 error
4. **Audit Trail** - All operations logged to storage-agent.log

## üö® If Data Recovery Needed

If you accidentally lost data, check:
1. **LanceDB backups** in `./data/vectors/feature_vectors.lance/_transactions/`
2. **Log files** in `logs/storage-agent.log` for recent operations
3. **Git history** if the database folder is under version control

## ‚ö° Your Data is Safe

Your **3,714 vectors** with trading data are protected from:
- Accidental bulk deletion
- Script-based data wipes  
- API misuse
- Mass data operations

**Only individual, intentional deletions are now possible.**
