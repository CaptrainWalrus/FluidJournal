# Fixes Implemented for Agentic Memory System

## 1. Fixed Missing Direction Field
**Problem**: Storage was failing with "direction is not defined" error
**Solution**: Added explicit direction determination in position registration:
```javascript
// Determine direction from pattern UUID or IBI condition
let direction = 'long'; // Default
if (patternUuid && (patternUuid.toLowerCase().includes('bear') || patternUuid.toLowerCase().includes('short'))) {
    direction = 'short';
} else if (ibiCondition && ibiCondition.toLowerCase().includes('short')) {
    direction = 'short';
}
```

## 2. Fixed EMA3 and VWAP Calculations
**Problem**: EMA3 and VWAP were returning `undefined` in feature generation
**Solution**: Added missing calculations in `calculatePercentageBasedFeatures()`:
```javascript
// Added EMA3 calculation
const ema3 = calculateEMA(bars, 3);
features.ema3_value = ema3;

// Added VWAP calculation and features
const vwap = calculateVWAP(bars);
features.vwap_value = vwap;
features.price_vs_vwap_pct = ((currentBar.close - vwap) / currentBar.close) * 100;
features.ema_vwap_distance = Math.abs(ema9 - vwap);
features.ema_vwap_distance_ticks = Math.abs(ema9 - vwap) / 0.1;
```

## 3. Implemented Risk Variation Strategy
**Purpose**: Create variation when running the same backtest multiple times
**Features**:
- Tracks outcomes for each unique signal
- Applies different risk strategies on repeated attempts:
  - `adjust_stops`: Vary stop loss based on previous outcome
  - `adjust_targets`: Vary take profit targets
  - `confidence_shift`: Vary entry confidence thresholds
  - `time_exit`: Vary holding period
  - `partial_exit`: Vary position sizing

**Example**: If a signal was profitable last time, the next attempt will:
- Use a wider stop loss (10% wider per attempt)
- Increase profit target if it hit target (15% higher)
- Lower confidence requirement to take more trades

## 4. Risk Service Integration
- Added variation strategy to `/api/approve-signal` endpoint
- Added `/api/record-outcome` endpoint to learn from results
- Added `/api/variation-stats` endpoint to monitor effectiveness

## Services That Need Restart
1. **ME Service** - To apply EMA3/VWAP fixes and direction field
2. **Risk Service** - To enable risk variation strategy

## Expected Improvements
1. **Direction field** will be properly set, eliminating storage errors
2. **EMA3 and VWAP** will calculate correctly instead of returning undefined
3. **Risk parameters** will vary between backtest runs, creating more diverse training data
4. **Better generalization** from varied stop losses, targets, and exit strategies

## Usage
When running repeated backtests:
1. First run uses base parameters
2. Second run adjusts stops based on first outcome
3. Third run adjusts targets
4. Fourth run adjusts confidence
5. Fifth run varies exit timing
6. Cycle continues with different variations

This ensures that even when backtesting the same time period multiple times, you get varied outcomes that help train a more robust system.
